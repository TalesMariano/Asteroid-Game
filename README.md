# Asteroids - Unity Coding Challenge

A modernized version of the classic **Asteroids** game, built in **Unity 2022.3.52**.  
This project focuses on clean, maintainable code, with configurable gameplay settings.

- **Escape** – Quit the game.
- **R** – Restart the game (reloads configuration files).
